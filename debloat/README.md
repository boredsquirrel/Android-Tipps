# Debloat your phone

Manufacturers bloat your phone with software you dont want.

Android normally uses containerized apps, which is why there are nearly no viruses. But systemapps are not containerized!

So even if you want to keep apps, if they are on Appstores you should install it as a normal user app and not as a system app with full permissions over your whole system!
